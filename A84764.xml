            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Letter from his Excellencie Sir Thomas Fairfax, ≈øent to both Hou≈øes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning the Kings being brought from Holdenby towards the Army.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY my la≈øt of Fryday the 4. in≈øtant, I gave you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I under≈øtood from Holmby concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the undertaking of ≈øome Souldiers on Wedne≈øday la≈øt to ≈øecure the King from being ≈øecretly conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that Col. Graves being therupon ≈øecretly ≈ølipt away, I had ≈øent Col. Whalley with his Regiment to attend the Comi≈ø≈øioners, and take charge of the guards
<pb facs="tcp:160263:3"/>there. On Satturday morning being at a Randezvouze beyond Newmarket, and advancing the Army this way in order quarter about Cambridge, I received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti≈øement, That the Souldiers of Holmby had upon Fryday morning (with his Maje≈øties con≈øent) brought him away from thence, together with your Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. That they lay at Hinchingbrook neare Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on Friday night, and would bee at Newmarket that day; The ground of this remove was alleadged to be an apprehen≈øion in the Souldiers, of ≈øome Forces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering towards that place ≈øuddenly to fall upon them and force the King out of their hands, to with≈øtand which, they thought they might be too weake (having then no notice of Col. Whaleyes coming with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment) upon this immediatly I ≈øent after C. Whaley to adverti≈øe him thereof, with order to direct his cour≈øe towards Huntingdon, and (where ere he met his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty and the Commi≈ø≈øioners) to de≈øire, that they would come on no further this way, but rather to returne, and ≈øuffer him to guard them back.</p>
            <p>And to prevent any danger imaginable therein, I ≈øent off from the Rendezvouze two Regiments of Hor≈øe more, to march after Col. Whalley towards Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ≈øo on towards Holdenby, to be a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to him in the Guards about his Maje≈øty if it ≈øhould bee found needfull.</p>
            <p>And thus I held on the motion of the re≈øt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my this way.</p>
            <p>Towards Evening (after the Quarters of the Armie were a≈ø≈øigned, and taken up hereabouts, and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments marching off towards their ≈øeverall Quarters, I under≈øtood from Colonel Whalley, that meeting the
<pb facs="tcp:160263:3"/>King and your Commi≈ø≈øioners upon their way from Huntington towards Newmarket, about foure miles ≈øhort of Cambridge, they had forborn to come on any further; but his Maje≈øtie being not willing to returne back for <hi>Holmby,</hi> they had taken up his Quarter for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent at Sir <hi>Iohn Cuts</hi> hou≈øe at <hi>Childerley,</hi> being the next hou≈øe of any conveniencie to the place where hee met them.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I ≈øent thither Sir <hi>Hardres Waller,</hi> and Col. <hi>Lambert,</hi> to informe the Commi≈ø≈øioners of my coming to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Armies quartering hereabouts, &amp; to de≈øire, that they would think of returning backe with his Maje≈øtie to <hi>Holdenby,</hi> and (becau≈øe there might be many inconveniencies in delay) that they would not make any ≈øtay where they were, but remove backe that way next morning (though it were the Lords Day) the Commi≈ø≈øioners refu≈øed to act or meddle any otherwi≈øe in di≈øpo≈øing the King, then by their An≈øwer to mee, (whereof I have ≈øent you a Copie here inclo≈øed) you ≈øee. And his Maje≈øtie declares him≈øelfe very anwilling to go back to <hi>Holmby.</hi> I have thus given you a true and faithfull account, how his Maje≈øtie came to the place where he is, and how the Quarters of the Army have fallen out to be ≈øo neare him.</p>
            <p>what ever (by the concurrence of events to make it thus) may be ≈øu≈øpected of de≈øigne therein. This is the exact truth of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and I can clearly profe≈ø≈øe, (as in the pre≈øence of God) for my ≈øelfe, and dare be confident of the ≈øame for all the Officers about me, and body of the Army, that this remove of his Maje≈øtie from <hi>Holmby</hi> was without any de≈øigne, knowledge, or privity thereof on our parts, and a thing altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb facs="tcp:160263:4"/>to us untill the notice of it came upon the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz as before; neither the Randezvouz or coming hither to quarter with the Army from any purpo≈øe, or with any expectation to be ≈øo neere His Maj. as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. But the effect is ≈øo farr meerly providentiall, and (to us) accidentall, but the ca≈øe being as it is (your Commi≈ø≈øioners refu≈øing to intermeddle as before, and the King to go back) I have placed and ≈øhall continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Maje≈øty ≈øuch a Guard of tru≈øty men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øuch Command, Collonel <hi>Whalley</hi> being chiefe in the charge) as I may be re≈øpon≈øall for to the Parliament and Kingdome, (≈øo farre as can rea≈øonably be expected from me) by the ble≈ø≈øing of God to ≈øecure his Maje≈øties per≈øon from danger, and prevent any attempts of ≈øuch as may de≈øigne, (by that advantage of his Per≈øon) the be≈øt to rai≈øe any new warre in this Kingdome. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (Sir,) to prevent any ≈øuch mi≈øchiefe as it is my owne mo≈øt earne≈øt and humble de≈øire, ≈øo I finde it to be the unanimous de≈øire and ≈øtudy of the Army, that a firme peace in this Kingdome may be ≈øetled, and the liberties of the people cleared and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured accordingly, to the many Declarations by which we were invited and induced to ingage in the late war: and the Parliaments effectuall and ≈øpeedy application to the≈øe two things (I find) would conduce more fully and ≈øurely to a chearefull and unanimous disbanding; And yet (what ever may be ≈øugge≈øted or ≈øu≈øpected) I do certainly find (and dare a≈ø≈øure you, you may depend upon it) That the ≈øence of the Army is mo≈øt cleer from any purpo≈øe, or inclination, to oppo≈øe the ≈øetling of Presbyterie, or to have the Independant Government
<pb facs="tcp:160263:4"/>≈øet up, or to up-hold a licentiou≈øne≈ø≈øe in Religion, or to meddle with any ≈øuch thing to the advancement of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular party or intere≈øt what≈øoever, but to leave all ≈øuch particular matters to the wi≈ødome of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall by the next ≈øend you a full Account of the proceeding and unanimous re≈øolutions of the Army at the late Randezvouze (being not at pre≈øent prepared ≈øo fully to do it as is fit) The letter from both Hou≈øes I have received but this night, the Quarters of the Army being lately altered before, will make the Heath neere Newmarket le≈ø≈øe convenient for a Randezvouze, yet I ≈øhall take order (according to the de≈øire of the Hou≈øes) to have a Randezvouze either there or nor fame of on Wedne≈øday next, I remain</p>
